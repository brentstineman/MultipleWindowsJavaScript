This sample code provides a demonstration of doing multiple Windows in a Visual Studio 2015, Windows 10 UWP application using HTML/JS. This sample code is an updated version of an [older Windows 8, Visual Studio 2013 sample](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Multiple-Views-Sample-2582fcf3).

The previous examples used WinJS 2's MSAppView. However, MSAppView was not carried forward to WinJS 4 and Windows 10 because JavaScript developers preferred known methods for performing this action.
